# BeveragePricePrediction
 # ML Beverage Sales Prediction Project  This project predicts the total price of beverage sales based on various features like `Unit_Price`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, and more. The project includes:  - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the dataset and its distributions. - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and encoding data. - **Model Training**: Training an XGBoost model to predict `Total_Price`. - **Deployment**: Creating a Flask API to serve the trained model.  ### How to Run: 1. Clone the repository. 2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 3. Run the Flask app: `python app/app.py`.  ### Files: - `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization. - `model_training.ipynb`: ML model training and evaluation. - `model/model.pkl`: Pickled model file. - `app/app.py`: Flask API for deployment.
